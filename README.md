The Advanced Voice Assistant is an interactive desktop application built using Python and Tkinter.
It is designed to assist users in managing daily tasks such as setting reminders, creating notes,
storing contacts, and interacting through speech recognition and text-to-speech technology. The
assistant provides a user-friendly graphical interface for both text-based and voice-based
interaction.
